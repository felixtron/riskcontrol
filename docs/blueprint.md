## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#2E5266), reflecting trust and professionalism.
- Background color: Off-white (#F2F4F7), providing a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFB300) to highlight important CTAs and sections, connoting value and success.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a modern, humanist sans-serif. The font is suitable for body text.
